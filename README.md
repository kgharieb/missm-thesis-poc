This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a simplified risk-driven hybrid Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework. It focuses on a "Customer Data Access Use Case" within a simulated multi-cloud environment, showcasing how access decisions can be made based on user roles, attribute, and a dynamically calculated risk score.
